            StudyBud is a web application that allows students to join a virtual study room to help each other 
            stay accountable. They will login, and the application will show a list of students currently joined. 
            Students can send each other encouragement that will or send a notification indicating that they have 
            completed their assignment. Similar to a scoreboard, there is a page that displays how many projects 
            a student has completed while logged into the study room. When a student enters, leaves, sends 
            encouragement, or completes an assignment, a notification message is sent to other students currently 
            in the study room.
