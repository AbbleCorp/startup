# StudyBud

[My Notes](notes.md)

StudyBud is a web application that allows students to join a virtual study room to help each other stay accountable. They will login, and the application will show a list of students currently joined. Students can send each other encouragement that will or send a notification indicating that they have completed their assignment. Similar to a scoreboard, there is a page that displays how many projects a student has completed while logged into the study room. When a student enters, leaves, sends encouragement, or completes an assignment, a notification message is sent to other students currently in the study room.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Study groups help hold one accountable, but sometimes in-person study sessions just aren't realistic. The StudyBud application allows students to join a virtual study room with other students to stay more productive and get more done. As each student joins, other students are notified so they can send each other encouragement. As a student finishes an assignment, they can add it to their total completed projects, so students can look back and see how much they've accomplished while studying with StudyBud. Upon indicating project completion, other students are notified so they can celebrate together!
